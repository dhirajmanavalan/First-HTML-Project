      <strong>Vikram</strong>&nbsp; is a <i>1986</i> Indian Tamil-language
      action spy film directed by Rajasekhar and written by Kamal Haasan and
      Sujatha. The film stars Haasan, Sathyaraj, Amjad Khan, Lissy, Dimple
      Kapadia, Charuhasan and Janagaraj. It is the first Indian film to use
      computer for recording the songs. The screenplay was first published as a
      serial in the magazine Kumudam. Both Lissy and Kapadia made their Tamil
      debut through this film.Although the film received mixed reviews, it
      performed well at the box office and turned out to be a commercially
      successful venture for Raaj Kamal Films International. A spiritual
      successor with the same name was released in 2022, with Haasan reprising
      his role of the title character.

      <strong>Maharaja</strong> is a <em>2024</em> Indian Tamil-language action thriller
      film[6] directed by Nithilan Saminathan. Produced by The Route, Think
      Studios and Passion Studios, the film stars Vijay Sethupathi, alongside
      Anurag Kashyap and Sachana Namidass (in her major film debut), with Mamta
      Mohandas, Natty Subramaniam, Abhirami, Divyabharathi, Singampuli,
      Aruldoss, Munishkanth, Manikandan, Bharathiraja and others. The story
      follows a barber in Chennai who goes to the police station to retrieve his

      else. The film was officially announced in February 2023 under the
      tentative title VJS50, as it is Sethupathi's 50th film as the lead actor.
      Principal photography commenced the same month, predominantly taking place
      in Chennai throughout a single schedule. The official title was announced
      in July, coinciding with the filming wrapping and Think Studios joining as
      co-producers. The music was composed by B. Ajaneesh Loknath, with
      cinematography by Dinesh Purushothaman and editing by Philomin Raj.
